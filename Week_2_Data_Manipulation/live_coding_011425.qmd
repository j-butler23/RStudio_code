## 3.2.5 exercises

1.  arrival delay of two or more hours
    1.  Flew to houston (IAH or HOU)

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
```

```{r}
flights |>
  #filter(arr_delay >= 120) |>
  #filter(dest %in% c("IAH", "HOU")) this way will also work. Use when looking for multiple things of a different name in the same column
  filter(dest == "HOU" | dest == "IAH")

```

3.   Departed in the summer

    ```{r}
    filter(flights, month %in% c(7,8,9))

    ```

4.  Arrive more than two hours late but didn't leave late

    ```{r}
    filter(flights, arr_delay > 120 & dep_delay <= 0)
    ```

5.  Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flights

    ```{r}
    filter(flights, dep_delay > 60 & dep_delay - arr_delay > 30)
    ```

6.  Departed between 12am and 6am

    ```{r}
    filter(flights, dep_time >= 0000 & dep_time <= 0600)
    ```

7.  Find the missing departure times

    ```{r}
    filter(flights, is.na(dep_time))
    ```

8.  Use arrange() to make all NA dep_times float to the top

    ```{r}
    arrange(flights, desc(is.na(dep_time)))
    ```
